So the name of the application is TODO List Android App.

I'll be demonstrating the features of this app on clicking I get a splash screen which shows us the app icon and then 
I move on to the main screen so let's talk about the design of the application, the design of the application is fairly simple we have a recycler view which consists of all 
the tasks in the app stored as a card view consisting of a check box and a text box. So now this is the whole layout and we have a floating action button which is in which 
is used to store new tasks or create a new task so this is the whole application layout. The app functions are related to the task creation of a new task editing 
the task and deletion of the task. So clicking on the plus button at the bottom we can create a new task clicking the plus button we open a bottom sheet where we can write the task and we can add it to my task list. 

we can swipe left and right to edit the task. To delete a task we can just swipe left. If we want to delete a task or not only if we click the confirm button the the task will be deleted. This ensures that you by mistake do not delete your task. This creates a good UI experience for the user. Because you are giving them a confirmation. so these are the functions of this to-do list application
